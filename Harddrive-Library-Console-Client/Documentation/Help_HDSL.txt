Hard Disk Search Language (HDSL) Help

	find [filesystem - default] [columns columnref[, columnref]] [in/within/under [path[, path, path]]] [where clause] [group clause] [order clause]; or
	find [wards | watches | hashlogs] [columns columnref[, columnref]] [path[, path, path]] [where clause] [group clause] [order clause];
		Retrieves the items that match the query and displays them.
		The following statements all do the same thing -- they search for .dll files in C:\Windows\System32 that are under 1mb in size.
			e.g find in 'C:\Windows\System32' where Size < 1024000 and Extension = '.dll';
			e.g find under 'C:\Windows\System32' where Size < 1024000 and Path ~ '.*\.dll$';
	purge [bookmarks | exclusions | watches | wards | hashlogs] | [path[, path, path] [where clause] [group clause] [order clause]];
		Removes matching entries from the current database.
		e.g purge; deletes all file tracking records from the database
		e.g purge exclusions; deletes all exclusions, etc.
	[Bookmark] = '<absolute directory path string>';
		Creates a bookmark reference.
		Bookmarks can be substituted for scan, exclusion definition, purge, and find paths.
		e.g [winSys] = 'C:\Windows\System'; creates a bookmark to the C:\Windows\System directory.
	scan [spinner|progress|text|quiet - defaults to text] [path[, path, path]];
		Performs a disk item scan with the requested display mode on the provided paths.  
		e.g scan text 'C:\'; will scan the entire C: drive and output progress to the console as text..
	check [spinner|progress|text|quiet - defaults to text] [columns columnref[, columnref]] [in/within/under] [path[, path, path] - defaults to current] [where clause] [group clause] [order clause];
		Performs a find query and then executes an integrity scan on the results of the query.
		Compares existing hashes to the database to newly generated ones.  If no previous integrity check has been performed, simply stores the values in the database.
		e.g scan text 'C:\'; will perform an integrity check on the entire C: drive and output progress to the console as text.
	exclude [dynamic] path[, path, path]; 
		Adds an exclusion for the given items.  Accepts file(s) and/or path(s).
		The dynamic keyword causes any bookmarks in an exclusion to be evaluated when the exclusion is enforced, as opposed to when it is created.
		e.g exclude [Win]; will be stored as an exclusion of the specified value of the [Win] bookmark, where as exclude dynamic [win]; will store the bookmark text.  This means that any changes made to [win] will automatically be picked up.
	include path[, path, path];
		Deletes exclusions for the given paths
		e.g include [win]; will remove the previous example.  Note that exclusions are not cascaded.
	-- creates a line comment.
	/* some text */ creates a multi-line comment.
    watch [passive] [path[, path, path] - defaults to current];
		Creates a watch for each of the given paths.  
		A watch performs an initial scan and then passively monitors location for activity, updating the database when any is detected.
	    The passive keyword causes the watch to start in passive mode and skip the initial scan.
		e.g watch 'C:\'; will watch the entire C: drive, automatically updating when changes occur after the initial scan.
	ward (time interval) [in/within/under [path[, path, path]] - defaults to current] [where clause] [group clause] [order clause];
		Performs an immediate integrity check and then successive ones whenever the interval expires.
		e.g ward 5::: under 'C:\Windows\System32' where extension = '.dll' and +system; will create a ward to perform an integrity check on .dll system files every 5 days.
		Time Intervals use the following syntax d:h:m:s where each number is optional, but the colons are required for meaning determination.
			e.g 5::: means 5 days.
			e.g 10:: means 10 hours.
			e.g 1::2:30 means 1 day, 2 minutes, and 30 seconds.
	* The set statement
	   * set out | standard | error path;
		 * Redirects the console's output to the provided path.
		 * Using standard changes the standard output, error the error, and out will change both.
		 * e.g set standard @'C:\HDSL\activity.log'; will reroute standard output to the C:\HDSL\Activity.log file.
	   * set alias [filesystem | wards | watches | hashlogs] columnref, span (width in characters);
		 * Changes the display width for the given column.
		 * e.g set filesystem Size, span 10; will set the display width of the Size column to 10 characters.
	   * set alias [filesystem | wards | watches | hashlogs] columnref, 'new alias string';
		 * Changes the alias for the given column to the new one provided.
		 * e.g set filesystem Size, 'Size'; will change the Size column's alias to 'Size', allowing it to be referenced by that name.
	   * set alias [filesystem | wards | watches | hashlogs] columnref, default 0/1;
	     * Changes the given column's default status, causing it to appear in relevant queries that omit the columns clause.
		 * e.g set filesystem Size, default 1; will make the Size column in the filesystem a default return value for queries.
	reset out | standard | error;
		Resets the targetting output stream to its default, thereby restoring it to the console.
		Using "standard" resets the standard output, "error" the error, and "out" will reset both.
		e.g reset standard; will reset the standard console output to its default destination.
	reset columnmappings;
		Recreates all of the column mappings, restoring them to their defaults.
		e.g reset columnmappings;

Special Keywords

	In HDSL, there are some special keywords that can be used universally, but only under specific circumstances.
		The force keyword can be used prior to any path or bookmark anywhere a list of paths is valid (see syntax above).  When used, it will cause the statement to no longer validate the path's existence.  This allows, for example, explicit exclusion of files that do not yet exist but will in the future.
		The ampersand (@), when preceding a string, will make that string ignore escape sequences.
